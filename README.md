# 👾 Monster Game

A simple and fun **interactive web-based game** where the player battles a monster using attack, special attack, and heal actions.  
This project was created to practice **JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling** in a playful way.

## 🧠 Overview

The **Monster Game** is a turn-based battle game where:
- The player and the monster both start with 100 health points.
- Each round, the player can choose to:
  - ⚔️ **Attack** — deal a random amount of damage to the monster.
  - 💥 **Special Attack** — deal heavier damage (limited use).
  - 💊 **Heal** — recover a portion of health.
  - 🛑 **Surrender** — end the game early.

After each move, the monster automatically retaliates with a counterattack.  
The game continues until either the player or the monster’s health drops to zero.
